            <strong>The Alpine Club, England is the first mountaineering club in the world. The main purpose of the club's establishment is to support those who climb mountains in the Alps and Greater Ranges - among the top mountains in the world.</strong>
            <p>Based on the world record nomination from the European Records Institute (EURI) and decision No. WK/USA.INDIA/676/2021/No.132, the World Records Union (WorldKings) officially Officially announced Alpine Club as " The world's first mountaineering club " on April 3, 2021.</p>

            <p>The Alpine Club was founded on 22 December 1857 by a group of British mountaineers at the Ashley Hotel in London. The club's original founders were active climbers in the Alps and were instrumental in the development of mountaineering during the Golden Age of Alpinism (1854â€“1865).</p>

            <p>The Alpine Club is famous for developing early mountaineering equipment with the invention of a new type of rope. The goal is to create a rope that is durable and lightweight so that it can be carried easily.</p>

            <p>Although the club organizes a number of indoor meetings and lectures in the UK, its main purpose has always been towards climbing activities around the world. The club has produced a set of guidebooks covering some of the famous Alpine climbing areas.</p>
            <img src={img4} alt=""></img>
            <p>In addition, the club also has an extensive library of books and photographs as well as an archive of historical artefacts that are regularly loaned for exhibitions.</p>
