        <h3>1. A Brief History of The Himalayan Club</h3>
        <p>For centuries, mountain communities have lived all along the great Himalayan range. From one end of the Himalaya near Arunachal Pradesh in the east, to the Western Karakoram and Hindu Kush ranges in Pakistan in the west, farmers, herdsmen and traders have eked out a precarious living on the slopes of the highest mountains in the world. The first outsiders to venture in the area in the mid-19th century were explorers and surveyors, looking to fill the blank areas on the map and calculate the heights of the peaks. They were followed by shikaris lured by the abundant game in the dense foothills of the mountains and also by botanists and zoologists delighted at the treasure trove of exotic plants, butterflies and birds. By the end of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th, they were joined by an ever increasing tribe of climbers. It is no surprise therefore the creation of a mountaineering club was talked about long before it came into existence. In fact when it did, not one but two clubs cropped up almost simultaneously – The Mountain Club of Calcutta and The Himalayan Club in Simla. The first meeting of The Himalayan Club took place on February 17th, 1928 and at this meeting it was decided to invite The Mountain Club to amalgamate with it; a proposal that was accepted. The first AGM of this united Himalayan Club took place in February 1929.</p>
        <p>At that first AGM there were 250 members: 127 founder-members, 49 former mem­bers of The Mountain Club and 74 ordinary members. The Raja of Jubbal was the only Indian on the rolls.</p>
        <p>The first job of the Club was to appoint ‘Local Secretaries’ in places where people set off for expeditions – Darjeeling, Chamba, Kashmir, Kumaon and Simla. These local secretaries would help with information and the hiring of porters and interpreters. Darjeeling soon became the most active chapter with an increasing number of expeditions both small and large setting out every year.</p>
        <p>A special relationship developed between The Himalayan Club and the Sherpas and Bhotias of Darjeeling. Lists of available porters were drawn up, porter books were issued in which leaders of expeditions would rate the work done by individual porters and in 1939 the Club decided to award TIGER badges to exceptional porters with proven ability on ice and rock. The possession of the TIGER badge meant higher rates of pay above the snow line and bestowed upon the porters respect and status. This relationship continued down the years. The last of the TIGER badges were given to select porters of the Indian 1965 Everest expedition. During the Club’s Millennium celebrations in 2000, tribute was paid to three surviving TIGERS: Ang Tsering, Nawang Gombu and Nawang Topgay. Ang Tsering subsequently passed away in 2001, Nawang Gombu in 2011 and Nawang Topgay in 2012 bringing to an end the era of the great Sherpa Tigers.</p>

        <h5>2.2. The Himalayan Club Kekoo Naoroji Book Award</h5>
        <p>Kekoo Naoroji, born in Karachi on 5 September 1915, to Jerbai and Nadirshaw Naoroji, was one of the pillars of the Himalayan Club, and its President from 1986 to 1992, was a man of the mountains with deep wellsprings of character and inner strength.</p>
        <p>He joined the Himalayan Club in 1950, a relationship he was to enjoy immensely for the next fifty years. In 1952 Kekoo spent eleven weeks in central Garhwal, and his personal diary of this trip, as well as the account of his other major trip to the Himalaya in 1958 in Sikkim, formed the subject matter of a book, Himalayan Vignettes, that was brought out by his son Rishad and assisted by friends in the Himalayan Club (particularly Satya Dam, Jagdish Nanavati, and Harish Kapadia).</p>
        <p>When the Himalayan Club moved its headquarters to Mumbai, Kekoo became its first Secretary in 1971, its Vice President from 1983 – 85, and for seven years thereafter was President of the Club. He took his responsibilities of helping to strengthen and consolidate Club activities seriously and his business experience enabled him bring a very pragmatic and sound sense to all the Committee dealings. He actually cared about each of the people around him, and they sensed and appreciated that. He passed away quietly on 17 December 2003 after a long period of ill health.</p>
        <p>In the year 2005, the Himalayan Club in association with Naoroji family and Godrej Industries set up a book award for the best literature on the Himalaya, published during the year. The book award instituted in his name would be for a book published in the prescribed period and relating to any aspects of the Himalaya. The books can cover mountains, mountaineering, people, culture, environment, politics and any other related topics.</p>
