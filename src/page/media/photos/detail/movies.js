            <p>Life is busy, and if you’re anything like us, a certain amount of distraction is in order. So if you’re looking for something that will enrich your knowledge of climbing lore or perpetuate your psyche or demonstrate just how poorly Hollywood understands climbing, consider some of these climbing movies.</p>
            <strong>The Dawn Wall</strong>
            <img className="img_bv" src={img01}/>
            <p><b>Description:</b> In January 2015, American rock climbers Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson captivated the world with their effort to climb <i>The Dawn Wall</i>, a seemingly impossible 3,000-foot rock face in Yosemite National Park, California.</p>
            <p>The pair lived on the sheer vertical cliff for weeks, igniting a frenzy of global media attention.</p>
            <p>But for Tommy Caldwell, <i>The Dawn Wall</i> was much more than just a climb. It was the culmination of a lifetime defined by overcoming obstacles. At the age of 22, the climbing prodigy was taken hostage by rebels in Kyrgyzstan. Shortly after, he lost his index finger in an accident but resolved to come back stronger. When his marriage fell apart, he escaped the pain by fixating on the extraordinary goal of free climbing <i>The Dawn Wall</i>.</p>
            <p>Blurring the line between dedication and obsession, Caldwell and his partner Jorgeson spend six years meticulously plotting and practicing their route. On the final attempt, with the world watching, Caldwell is faced with a moment of truth. Should he abandon his partner to fulfill his ultimate dream, or risk his own success for the sake of their friendship?</p>

            <img className="img_bv" src={img03}/>
            <p><b>Description:</b> On July 12, 2018, professional climber, Sasha DiGiulian, set out to become the first woman and second person in history to complete the Rocky Mountain Trilogy, a compilation of three of the hardest 5.14 big walls in the Canadian Rockies. The imposing climbs, on Castle Mountain, Mount Louis, and Mount Yamnuska, respectively will take Sasha 2 months of continued effort with the ultimate goal of ascending each sheer wall in a single day push, with zero falls — a combined average of over 9,000 vertical feet of climbing at a lung-busting average elevation of 7,000ft. Setbacks with climbing partners, a shoulder injury, and mounting wildfires, DiGiulian is faced with ever-increasing obstacles and forced to balance her goals with her safety. This is not only an extraordinarily unique physical journey, but a universal introspective story of overcoming fear, the importance of self-confidence, and in finding friends when and where you least expect them. Pushing through the uncomfortable moments and riding the ups and downs of life, DiGiulian drives herself through mounting fatigue and a closing weather window to strive for her historical goal.</p>

            <p><b>Description:</b> Hailed as one of the most prolific, influential climbers of all time, Fred Beckey’s adventures began in Washington’s North Cascade range with his brother Helmy in the 1930s.

This success marked the beginning of Fred’s epic tear of first ascents around the world, during which he became the consummate “Dirtbag” climber: defined as one who forgoes material comforts and defies societal norms in pursuit of a nomadic mountaineering lifestyle. Director Dave O’Leske spent the past decade filming Fred Beckey with unprecedented access, getting to know the mythical man in the mountains of China, across North America and in his Pacific Northwest home.</p>
