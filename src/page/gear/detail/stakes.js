        <h1>How should tent stakes be chosen for different terrain surfaces?</h1>
        <p>The 12 best tent stakes for all types of terrain</p>
        <p>This happens every year: I'm going on my first camping trip of the season, I look at my camping gear and remember… I still haven't replaced those bent and twisted tent stakes.</p>
        <p>They're never the first thing you think of in terms of camping gear—in the age of hammock tents, truck tents, and rooftop tents, thinking about the best tent stakes for your setup more like a final thought.</p>
        <p>While their history is a footnote on your camping gear checklist, tent stakes are a tough sell—and making their efficiency a priority is something you won't regret doing. When used properly, they will keep you safe in all types of weather and keep your tent safely on the ground.</p>
        <h3>The best tent stakes for any camping surface</h3>
        <p>The hassle of trying to push a bent stake into the ground had me vowing that this was the year I would finally replace them with the best tent stakes available. Thankfully, countless outdoor brands know the importance of good tent stakes. These 12 options are all solid upgrades to the cheap options you might be using.</p>
        <h2>Tent stakes for camping on standard land</h2>
        <p>1. MSR Ground Hog Stake</p>
            <img className="img_bv" src={img1}/>
        <p>Made from Easton aluminum, these poles are lightweight (0.5 oz) yet very strong. With three sides and one end threaded with a nylon zipper, these are great little poles for both backpacking and car camping.</p>
        <p>2. NEMO Airpin Stake</p>
        <img className="img_bv" src={img2}/>
        <p>This is a favorite for backpacking, made from 7075 aluminum and only 10 grams per pole. Thanks to their tapered geometric design, pounding them into the ground won't result in useless stakes bending. There's no zipper, but you can attach your own if you want.</p>
        <p>3. Coleman steel tent stakes</p>
        <img className="img_bv" src={img3}/>
        <p>These 10-inch Coleman poles are made from galvanized steel. With a mallet or a good driver, you can use these stakes in any type of soil, no matter how hard packed. The tops are made of polypropylene, and although they are quite durable, they will eventually break. Using a set of pliers to pull from steel will help the product have a longer life.</p>
        <h2>Stakes for camping tents on hard ground</h2>
        <p>The stakes that come with your tent usually cannot withstand a heavy pounding into hard, compact ground. In our opinion, the following stakes are the best tent stakes on the market for hard ground or clay surfaces.</p>
        <p>4. Vargo Titanium nail pins</p>
        <img className="img_bv" src={img4}/>
        <p>These little spikes are essentially long, thin spikes made of titanium with a reflective ring attached for easy removal. They stake flat tops and straight shafts that won't bend when driven into even the hardest ground, and each stake weighs only 0.6 oz. This peg comes in a standard and ultralight version — the ultalight version is great for backpacking at just 0.3 oz per peg.</p>
        <p>5. Sea to Summit ground control pin</p>
        <img className="img_bv" src={img5}/>
        <p>These three-sided tent stakes are made of anodized 7075 T6 alloy, making them extremely strong and durable while remaining lightweight (0.5 oz per stake). If you're camping on hard ground, it's difficult to set stakes deep enough to get proper grip and leverage for your line. However, these poles have multi-height lines, virtually eliminating this problem.</p>
        <p>6. MSR Carbon Core Tent Stakes</p>
        <img className="img_bv" src={img6}/>
        <p>Made from lightweight yet strong 7075 aluminum and constructed from carbon fiber, these tent poles have sturdy aluminum heads, a great feature for driving these tent poles into hard ground. There are two size options, 6” (0.35 oz) and 9” (0.5 oz), both with attached reflective pull loops.</p>
        <h2>Tent stakes for camping on the sand</h2>
        <p>Camping in sandy places like coastal areas, mountain lakes, and Death Valley is popular, but most traditional poles will not be suitable for camping in the sand. If you're someone who frequently camps in the sand, these are the best tent stakes for your camping style.</p>
        <p>7. Orange screw</p>
        <img className="img_bv" src={img7}/>
        <p>
            Simply called The Orange Screw, these poles are similar in design to the bottom of a beach tent. The long screw design digs deep into the sand to really secure your ropes and tent, and the result is a stake that remains reliable in soft sand or high winds. They are made in the USA from recycled polycarbonate and come in two sizes. The 9” coin is 1.8 oz, and the 12” coin is 3.6 oz.
        </p>
        <p>
            8. MSR Cyclone pile
        </p>
        <img className="img_bv" src={img8}/>
        <p>
            These spiral-style stakes are designed to drill into soft ground, creating a secure anchor in windy, sandy, or even snowy conditions. At 10 inches long, they are still lightweight at 1.2 oz per pole. Due to their length and general weight, they are not ideal for backpacking.
        </p>
        <p>
            9. MSR Blizzard Tent Stake
        </p>
        <img className="img_bv" src={img9}/>
        <p>
            Made of 7000-series aluminum, this lightweight tent stake is reliable in sand and snow. The holes in the sand or snow stakes are there for a reason — the sand or snow fills in and around each hole to further secure the stake to the ground.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Poles for snow camping
        </h2>
        <p>
            Snow and sand cause similar problems when pitching a tent: lack of grip and slippery, slippery substances that often fail to hold the stakes. While there is some crossover between sand stakes and snow stakes, we found these to be the best tent stakes for camping in the snow.
        </p>
        <p>
            10. REI Co-op Snow Stakes
        </p>
        <img className="img_bv" src={img10}/>
        <p>
            All snow stakes generally have one thing in common: the holes are placed across the entire stake. This design allows the stakes to fill with snow, thereby anchoring each stake in place. These aluminum tent stakes are 9.6 inches long and weigh just one ounce per stake, making them a good choice for both car camping and backpacking.
        </p>
        <p>
            11. MSR Toughstake
        </p>
        <img className="img_bv" src={img11}/>
        <p>
            Boasting “ten times the holding power” of standard tent stakes, the Toughstake is a reliable anchor in both snow and sand. Made of aircraft-grade aluminum and stainless steel cables, these are some of the best tent stakes on the market for durability, reliability, and stability.
        </p>
        <p>
            12. Suluk 46 Titanium Snow Stake
        </p>
        <img className="img_bv" src={img12}/>
        <p>
            The most expensive on this list by far, this stake is shorter and wider than other models and offers multiple options for anchoring. It's also lightweight (0.5 oz each), making it an ideal choice for winter backpacking in the snow. The holes (many!) on this stake act as an installation device. Snow packs in and around the holes of each stake, creating a safe option for pitching your tent in the snow.
