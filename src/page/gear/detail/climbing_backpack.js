            <h1>Types of climbing backpacks</h1>
            <p>The weight and size of a backpack depends a lot on the length of the intended trip, as well as the mode of travel, weather conditions and the amount of gear you want to bring on a trip.</p>
            <h2>Trekking backpack for the day</h2>
            <p>Most daypacks have a capacity of 20 liters - 35 liters for high-end models. While smaller sized packs like a 10L hiking backpack  are usually adequate for day trips, you'll want a larger pack in the 35 liter range for all-day treks because it's easier to carry extra water, food, clothing and necessary items.</p>
            <p>Most good daypacks have comfortable, adjustable, durable straps that are well padded for shoulder comfort. There are many backpacks that are torn apart because of poor quality shoulder straps.</p>
            <img className='img_bv' src={img2}></img>
            <p>The main function of the shoulder strap is to help you carry the weight of the backpack on your shoulders, so the strap must be strong enough.</p>
            <p>The back is padded with ventilated mesh to help reduce heat accumulation, prevent excessive sweating and protect your back from sharp objects kept inside the backpack.</p>
            <p>Countless pockets for small items allow you to hold water bottles, snacks, documents, keys (some lines have special compartments for keys), cell phones and other necessary small items.</p>
            <h2>Weekend hiking backpack (1-3 days)</h2>
            <p>You cannot use most 30L daypacks for overnight trips because overnight trips will require carrying more items, such as sleeping bags, comforters, sleeping pads, and pants. pajamas, tent/hammock, stove/cooking pot, personal items and more food and drink.</p>
            <p>All these extra things require more backpack space, even if you take a minimalist or ultra-lightweight approach to packing enough items. For a 1-3 night weekend trip, it would be great to have a trekking backpack with a capacity of 40 - 50 liters.</p>

            <h2>Picnic backpack for long trips (3-5 days)</h2>
            <p>The biggest difference between weekend backpacks and multi-day backpacks is the need to carry more food and maybe a little more technical gear, and it also depends on your needs. type of activity or climate where you travel.</p>
            <p>For long trips, you will need a backpack with a capacity larger than a 30L hiking backpack , perhaps 50 - 70 liters, but if you use folding equipment that does not take up much space, you can be done with a smaller hiking backpack .</p>
            <img className='img_bv' src={img4}></img>
            <h2>Expedition backpack (5 days or more)</h2>
            <p>Expedition backpacks are the grandest of the backpack world, ranging in size from 80 - 110 liters or more. They are designed to hold huge amounts of food and equipment, often for professional mountaineering trips.</p>
            <img className='img_bv' src={img5}></img>
            <p>If you are going on a trip like this, you can rent a backpack because expedition backpacks are usually quite expensive.</p>
            <h1>Special features of climbing backpacks</h1>
            <h2>Suspension system </h2>
            <p>The suspension system is the most important feature to consider when choosing a backpack for hiking, it supports the load and is the part that comes into contact with your body. So, finding a backpack with an adjustable suspension system is a huge plus.</p>
            <p>A quality, properly equipped suspension system will allow you to carry your load comfortably and with balance. Poor quality can cause pain to your body.</p>
            <h2>Types of Frames </h2>
            <h3>Inner frame backpack</h3>
            <p>Fits comfortably inside the fabric of the backpack, often completely integrated and hidden, making it better for use on difficult terrain.</p>
            <h3>Outer frame backpack</h3>
            <p>There is a simple frame that helps lift the backpack higher than your back to help balance gravity, suitable for support when loading heavy items.</p>
            <img className='img_bv' src={img6}></img>
            <h3>Frameless backpack</h3>
            <p>This design is popular in the form of school backpacks and 10L hiking backpacks , and 20L daypacks for hiking. They are often made of ultra-lightweight and minimalist materials. Without a rigid structure, most of the weight falls on the shoulders. This can cause long-term discomfort even with modest loads.</p>
            <img className='img_bv' src={img7}></img>
            <h2>Hip belt</h2>
            <p>It is by far the most important part of any backpack suspension system, it is designed to handle loads of over 10kg. A well-fitting, well-padded hip belt transfers most of the pack's weight from the shoulders to the hips, allowing the wearer to stand upright and carry the load comfortably for hours.</p>
            <img className='img_bv' src={img8}></img>
            <h2>Shoulder strap</h2>
            <p>Not only does it prevent the backpack from falling off your back. Many of the straps are also curved so that they lie flat under the arm without twisting. The key to getting a good fit is to see if the distance between the shoulder straps is comfortable.</p>
            <h2>Sternum strap</h2>
            <p>The sternum strap helps stabilize the backpack. They are especially useful for stability when skiing or racing and can shift pressure points from heavy loads over long distances. The position of the sternum strap is quite important, it should be placed high, just below your neck, to reduce pressure on your chest.</p>
            <h2>Internal compartment of climbing backpack</h2>
            <p>Most large hiking packs have a zippered bottom compartment, although you may only need one large compartment for your gear. Compartments with long zippers that run vertically around the backpack or curve down to the bottom edge of the backpack are the easiest to use.</p>
            <p>Some backpack manufacturers also offer lines with more than two compartments.</p>
            <p>Buckles and clasps</p>
            <p>There are many different options, but the most widely used backpack opening and closing systems include buckles or zippers (pulled zippers are much more convenient to use especially in winter conditions), hook straps and drawstring with cord lock.</p>
            <p>All types of clasps have their own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
