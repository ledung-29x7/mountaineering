                <h1>All knowledge about camping tents</h1>
    <p>If you're looking for inflatable tents for sale or courting picnickers or just want a new camping tent for the family, you've probably come across something like the '150D 320gsm Oxford Poly Cotton HH 6000mm'. Have you ever wondered what the difference is between tent fabrics? What is a hydrostatic head, if you've heard of it? Why is there PU paint, what is PU paint?</p>
    <p>Denier, thread count, grams per square inch, hydrostatic head… hmmm…</p>
    <p>Recently, it has become what we used to see before with personal computers, RAM memory, mobile phones, cameras or TVs: a lot of technical staff, above all NUMBERS, thrown in The bigger you and the REST the better, right?</p>
    <p>Well, not so much, when it comes to choosing tent fabric. Each type of tent fabric has different qualities, good points and bad points. Choosing the right one mainly depends on your NEEDS, how you will use your tent, its purpose.</p>
    <p>You've probably heard of many different types of tent fabrics from polyester to poly-cotton, not to mention different brands like OutTex or Protex or Sentinel, just to name a few. Of course, they all claim they are better than everyone else, but the fact that you don't even know what's behind the catchy brand names, doesn't help either.</p>
    <p>You probably also realize that there are fabrics that are more expensive and there are fabrics that are cheaper, but the fact that one is more expensive does not make it BETTER, if it is not SUITABLE FOR THE PURPOSE you need it for.</p>
    <h3>Types of Tent Fabrics - What's the Difference?</h3>
    <p>Therefore, each type of tent fabric has good points and bad points. For example, maybe you need a lightweight tent that's easy to carry, or do you need a tent that you set up in June and you won't touch until September, even in the worst weather? Or do you need something that dries quickly so you can leave camp as early in the morning as possible?</p>
    <p>Most tents are made of nylon or polyester. Here on the 10ts tents you mainly find polyester and poly-cotton tents, as nylon is often used for light backpacking tents and not so much for big(r) and heavy(ier) family tents or top tents roof.</p>
    <h3>Polyester tent fabric</h3>
        <img className="img_bv" src={img1}/>
    <p>Polyester is a popular choice because it is cheap and performs well in different weather conditions. Polyester is the most common fabric used in tents. Although it's not waterproof (unless coated), it doesn't change shape when wet (unlike nylon) and doesn't perform too badly in sunlight.
        <p>It's also more durable than nylon, and although heavier, it's not too heavy and packs quite small. Polyester is also relatively quick to dry and is naturally resistant to mold and tears.
        </p>
        <p>On the other side of the coin, especially if compared to, THE, traditional tent fabrics, cotton, polyester are not good insulators. This means that polyester tents can get very hot when it's warm and cold when it's cold. Additionally, especially once a coating has been applied, it is not breathable, which can lead to condensation inside.
        </p>
        <p>Also remember that they can lose color over time when exposed to sunlight, and the fabric weakens as UV rays break down the molecules.
        </p>
        <p>Advantages: low maintenance, heavy-duty, resistant to pulling and tearing, not too heavy, affordable, small package, good mold resistance, waterproof
        </p>Disadvantages: No great UV protection, poor insulation, low breathability causing condensation, limited lifespan</p>
        <h3>Cotton/canvas tent fabric</h3>
        <img className="img_bv" src={img2}/>
    <p>Cotton or canvas is the original fabric, the fabric your grandfather might have used. A long time ago canvas was made from hemp, but today tent canvas is made from cotton. Manufacturers tend to use both which can cause confusion, but the two types - cotton and canvas - are the same.
        </p>
        <p>Cotton material is thick, durable and breathable, naturally waterproof, no coating required. As water begins to seep into the fabric, the fibers will expand and swell, sealing the gaps between the threads. It may leak for the first time in the rain because the swelling process takes place over time, so it is good advice to choose the weather/season for the cotton tent before using it for the first time.
        </p>
        <p>Cotton also has very good insulating properties, it is an excellent heat insulator. The tent will stay cool in the summer and stay warm if the weather turns cooler.
        </p>
        <p>Since it is naturally breathable and absorbs water, you won't have any problems with condensation. It is thick and heavy, which not only makes it a good insulator but also a very good sound insulator: it is quieter, you won't hear the slightest breeze hitting the thin fabric like in a polyester tent.
        </p>
        <p>On the negative side, cotton is heavy and bulky. It is not easy to carry due to its weight, and you have to carefully check that it fits in the trunk of your car. Pitching also requires more effort.
        </p>
        <p>It also requires more maintenance. You need to dry the material before storing the tent, otherwise you will get mold in the tent. And drying it can take longer than any polyester tent, because cotton absorbs water.
        </p>
        <p>Cotton, being a natural fabric, tears much more easily, which can turn into large tears very easily.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, cotton tents are not cheap.
        </p>
        <p>Advantages: breathable, naturally waterproof, low condensation, good insulation, long life, high UV resistance
        </p>
        <p>Disadvantages: expensive, heavy, bulky, susceptible to mold, cannot be used at all, requires maintenance, needs to dry before packaging</p>
        <h3>Polycotton tent fabric</h3>
        <img className="img_bv" src={img3}/>
        <p>Poly-cotton is a blend of cotton and polyester. While keeping all the good qualities of cotton, it has some of the benefits of polyester tents. The main fabric is cotton, with polyester in the weave so it inherits some mold resistance, is more durable and less prone to tearing than pure cotton.
            </p>
            <p>Poly-cotton can be left uncoated but often has a coating applied to repel water. Its durability, breathability and weather resistance make it great for family camping tents, canopies and rooftop tents.
            </p>
            <p>Advantages: more resistant to mold and mildew than cotton, more resistant to UV and heat than polyester, breathable, less moisture and condensation, longer life and better weight than cotton
            </p>
            <p>Disadvantages: price, still heavy and bulky, less mold resistant than polyester</p>
        <h3>Oxford fabric</h3>
        <img className="img_bv" src={img4}/>
        <p>Oxford is another weave that offers better strength and durability. Although it feels like cotton, it is waterproof, strong and durable; it is significantly lighter.
            </p>
            <p>
                So which tent fabric is best?
            </p>
            <p>
                As I said at the beginning, it depends a lot on the purpose. When I write a review of an inflatable tent or canopy tent and I ask the question "who is it for?"; I always consider the fabric first.
            </p>
            <p>
            Poly cotton tents give you a relaxing feeling of home thanks to their better thermal properties, making them ideal as a family tent. But due to their weight, I wouldn't necessarily recommend a quick weekend break; a polyester tent will suit that purpose a little better.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every fabric has good properties and bad properties, and I cannot stress enough how important it is that you know how you will use the tent.
            </p>
            <p>
                So for families, if you can afford it, transport it and display it; choose canvas/cotton, or poly-cotton. The second part, i.e. the pitching part, can be defeated easily if you use an inflatable poly cotton tent. If you are camping in cooler weather, i.e. outside of the summer holidays, I highly recommend a cotton or poly-cotton tent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Otherwise, a sturdy polyester or nylon tent will work fine. If it gets too hot, just open the vents and make sure you have as many screens as possible, so you can let fresh air in and keep the bugs out during the night.</p>
                <h3>Denier</h3>
                <img className="img_bv" src={img5}/>
            <p>Denier (D) is a unit of measurement for the weight and thickness of each thread used in fabric. The higher the Denier; the fabric is thicker, stronger and heavier. You also have to count different fabrics because they have different strengths. Stronger fabrics like nylon typically require less Denier to create a durable and sturdy tent AND keep the weight as low as possible. So you will find lower Denier in ultralight tents and tarps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Camping tents often use higher Denier polyester fabric, the most common values ​​are 68D, 70D, 75D.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Camping tents with 150D or more are ideal for longer exposure to the sun and harsh weather. Aside from some examples of 150D camping tents, this fabric is more typical in event shelters where it needs to withstand more stress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rooftop tents are different beasts, and it's not uncommon for us to see 320-400D fabric on them.</p>
                    <h3>Thread count</h3>
                    <img src={img6}/>
            <p>Thread count (T) represents the amount of thread used per square inch of fabric. For example 190T means 190 threads used horizontally and vertically per square inch. This also means that the thicker the thread (higher Denier), the lower the thread count will be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A higher thread count means greater density in the fabric, so you will most likely find a higher thread count with lower Denier fabrics. But don't fall for the numbers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A high thread count can certainly create better fabrics, but it is the thread that is the most important factor. In fact, a better quality fabric with a lower thread count will feel 'softer' and better made than a lower quality fabric with a higher thread count.
                </p>
                <p>So, higher thread count does not mean stronger fabric but it depends on the quality and thickness of the thread used. In fact, if I didn't know anything else about the flysheet or basesheet other than the string count (and it's intended to be GOOD), I'd be suspicious…</p>
            <h3>GSM</h3>

            <p>In simple terms, it means the weight of the fabric, GSM refers to grams per square meter. But fabric weight is usually the definition of the thickness of the garment itself, but it's not always that simple because higher gsm means heavier, thicker fabric.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You must also note that the weight does not tell you the type of thread used and how dense the thread count is. Fabrics with different threads or weaves but the same weight may not have the exact same thickness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is also important to note that the weight of a material does not always determine its quality. Different textiles will have different weights, which is necessary for its end use. While most tents range between 280gsm and 380gsm, you will find modern 'premium' polycotton tents at the lower end of this range.
                </p>
                <p>
                So most of the time, the higher the GSM, the stronger and heavier the canvas will be; But don't compare apples with oranges...</p>
            <h3>RipStop</h3>
            <img className="img_bv" src={img8}/>
            <p>Ripstop fabric is a thin, light and waterproof material, made from a combination of many different fabrics. During the weaving process, a stronger thread - usually nylon or polyester - is added at regular intervals, forming a distinctive rectangular pattern.
            </p>
            <p>
                This reinforcement makes any tears and tears less likely to spread, which makes it ideal for using it in outdoor gear, including tents and other things like jackets. Waterproof, pocket, etc
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite being a premium, breathable material, the name RipStop is a bit misleading… You see it everywhere, more often on expensive outdoor gear, and it's certainly a feature. especially on some mid-range to high-end tents. But what exactly does it mean? Well, that certainly doesn't mean the fabric will never tear.
            </p>
            <p>
                So keep in mind when buying a tent, that barrier will limit damage, but the tent won't magically become "tear-proof".
            </p>
                <p>
                    Still not clear?
                </p>
                <p>
                    What makes it even more confusing, is that tent manufacturers tend NOT to disclose all the specifications of the tent fabric they use. This makes it almost impossible to compare two different fabrics.
                </p>
                <p>
                For example, tent A has a 150D polyester flyer, tent B has a 320gsm polyester flyer, while tent C has a 75D 220T flyer. Those numbers don't translate to each other, a 75D fabric can easily have a thinner thread density, thus making it even heavier than a 150D fabric. While 320gsm does not indicate anything about the quality, density or thickness of the fibers…</p>
                <h3>Polyurethane/PU coating</h3>
                <img className="img_bv" src={img9}/>
                <p>PU coating is used to make the tent fabric waterproof. It can be applied to polyester and nylon fabrics, creating a water-repellent layer. It is affordable and has good breathability.
                    </p>
                    It does not penetrate the fabric but acts as an adhesive layer on the surface, thus allowing the tape to be applied to the seams. Depending on the type of chemicals used and the number of layers applied, it determines the Hydrostatic millimeter rating (see more below) of the tent.
                    <p>   
                    On the other hand, it requires to be kept clean and dry for storage. Another downside is that UV exposure breaks down chemical bonds over time, thereby reducing the tent's weather resistance over its lifespan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What you need to consider, it does NOT limit the breathability of the polyester or nylon fabric, so the thicker the PU coating, the less breathable the fabric. That also means increased weight, increased costs, and the chemicals in the coating can also weaken the fabric.
                    </p>   
                    <p>   
                    Additionally, the quality of the coating may vary between manufacturers; this can ultimately determine how long you will be able to camp without rainwater leaking through the flyer…</p>
                <h3>Silicone coating (also called silnylon)</h3>
                <img className="img_bv" src={img10}/>
                <p>Nylon - like polyester - is waterproof. Instead of PU coating, you can see that silicone coating is applied to nylon fabric, called sil-nylon.
                    </p>
                <p>
                    The silicone coating goes between the fibers of the nylon fabric, so on the plus side, it strengthens the nylon fabric, making it more durable, as well as making it waterproof. Silicone repels water, so you can easily wipe water droplets off the silnylon surface. It also dries much faster.
                </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other hand, silicone coatings aren't cheap, and because they fill the gaps between fabric fibers, air can't get through either. The lack of steam in the fabric means that water vapor can build up quickly and make the fabric surface very slippery.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Silnylon tent seams cannot be glued, as they will not stick to smooth surfaces. Seams should be sealed by hand, using a liquid sealant. To overcome this, manufacturers can apply a silicone coating on the outside and a PU coating on the inside, this is called SIL/PU coating.</p>
                <h3>Other coatings (UPF, SPF, etc.)</h3>
                <p>There are many other coatings that can be applied to tent fabric. Most notable are those with fire retardant properties and those that increase UV protection. UV protection is also important to protect the PU coating from breaking down over time, so the UV coating can contribute to the tent's overall water resistance.
                    </p>
                    Ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) indicates the level of UV radiation (both UVB and UVA) that a fabric can reach your skin. For example, a UPF 50 fabric blocks 98 percent of sun rays and allows two percent (1/5) to pass through, thereby significantly reducing your risk of exposure.
                <p>
                    What you need to know: A fabric must have a UPF of 30 to qualify for the Skin Cancer Foundation Recommended Mark. UPFs of 30 to 49 provide very good protection, while UPF rates of 50+ are excellent.
                </p>
                    <p>
                    Be careful, as some manufacturers (Coleman) show SPF only for UV protection, not UPF: UPF measures both UVB and UVA rays, while SPF only measures UVB.</p>
                <h3>Hydrostatic head (HH)</h3>
                <p>The Hydrostatic Head (HH) measurement indicates how waterproof the fabric is. Measurements are given in millimeters: this is the maximum height of the column of water standing on the fabric before it penetrates the fabric.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According to Ultralight Outdoor Gear, testing used to be done using a physical water column, but as fabrics have evolved, ratings have gotten higher for this method. Today, testing is performed using a machine that reproduces the downward pressure that a water column of this height would create.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The machine increases the pressure of the water pushed against the fabric until water is visible on the other side. The required level of pressure used to force water through the fabric is then converted into a measurement of how high the water column will be. This provides the results of the Hydrostatic Head test in millimeters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most of the tents discussed here in terms of 10ts tents have at least 1500mm HH or (waaay) above. Generally, HH 1000mm means the tent is 'shower-proof'. You can find this rating on cheap pop-up tents, beach tents, etc. Heavy rain and wind will put more pressure on the fabric, so the fabric needs to be at least 1500-2000mm HH to be considered " Waterproof".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anything over 2000mm HH means the tent will keep water out even if it is pushed through by something physical, i.e. plants rubbing against it, or people or backpacks/equipment leaning against it .
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ideally, a base chart should have a HH rating of around 3000mm or higher, as the pressure on the material can be quite great when you sit, sleep or walk on it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Canvas fabrics do not have an HH rating because they have a different way of keeping water out (see above). However, there are some manufacturers that apply a light waterproofing treatment on their tents. This allows for faster drying times and the cotton remains breathable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One thing you have to remember - again - the HH rating evaluates the fabric, not the waterproof quality of the entire tent. There are many other ways rainwater can get inside the tent (zips, seams, vents, lack of cover, etc.) so the overall weather resistance of the tent depends on many factors. other.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That's why you can't simply say that a 6000mm HH tent is more waterproof than a 2000mm HH tent. It's about fabric. Not a tent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One company is an exception: Quechua. They don't (always) say the HH rating of their tents (but when they do, it's 2000mm HH). On the other hand, they put their tents through rigorous testing to simulate terrible weather conditions (heavy storms, wind tunnels), and they measure the overall weather resistance of their tents . It's very impressive and very convincing, and I really like this approach.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Not sure if I made it clearer for you, or you just have more questions. But I hope that from now on you will be able to narrow down the vast choice of tents to the tents that you really NEED.</p>
