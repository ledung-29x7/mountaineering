            <p>Vietnam is a country with many breathtaking landscapes – from the cascading terraces of the Northwest or thousands of unique limestone islands in Ha Long Bay, to the seaside drinking paths in Phu Yen - Binh Thuan, or the maze of rivers in the Mekong Delta. Domestic and foreign visitors have countless travel options not to be missed in the wonderful S-shaped land. However, a little-known fact is that Vietnam is currently the country that owns the largest cave in the world - Son Doong Cave</p>
            <h3>Where is Son Doong Cave?</h3>
            <p>Mountian River Cave, the largest cave in the world, is located in the heart of Phong Nha-Ke Ban National Park, Quang Binh province, Vietnam. It was formed during the Cambrian-Permian geological epochs, dating from 400–450 million years old. There are no words that can judge or estimate the size or beauty of Son Doong. The cave is now recognized and protected by UNESCO. The cave has a width of 150m, a height of more than 200m, a length of nearly 9km. It is estimated that the capacity of Son Doong Cave is 36.8 million cubic meters. The main cave is large enough to accommodate an entire New York City building.</p>

            <p>What's even more amazing is the ecosystem created in the cave. It has its own weather system and creates its own clouds. Inside, you'll find massive stalactites, some up to 80 meters tall, and fossils dating back millions of years. The cave has two "skylights", which are two sinkholes where sunlight can shine into the cave to help plants grow and develop.</p>

            <p>In the cave, you will encounter bushes and water streams covered with misty clouds, and microorganisms that thrive in the dark. It is a completely different world, without the intervention of human hands. You will see a strange image of the Earth like hundreds of millions of years ago.</p>

            <h3>The process of finding Son Doong cave</h3>
            <p>Son Doong was first discovered in 1990, by a local named Ho Khanh. While walking through the forest in search of food and wood for a living, he came across a large hole, and when he looked inside, he saw clouds and heard the sound of running water. He was quite frightened not to linger long, so he returned home, forgetting the exact location of this cave.</p>
            <img src={img6} alt=""></img>
            <p>It wasn't until 2008 that Ho Khanh once again found Son Doong cave. He documented the way to the cave, then led Howard and Deb Limbert of the Royal Cave Society to the cave. In 2013, the cave was unveiled to the public. The government has also allowed cave expeditions, and the locality has also started organizing excursions to Son Doong cave.</p>

            <p>Visitors wishing to explore the cave will join the five-day expedition, especially not for the faint of heart. An expedition costs $3,000, which is not small but worth it if you love exploring. Because Son Doong cave is mainly protected for scientific research, and many people who have participated in the expedition have indescribable emotions when witnessing the surreal beauty inside this cave.</p>
            <img src={img8} alt=""></img>
            <p>However, only those who have health and patience can join the expedition, because despite the expensive cost, the list of people who sign up for the Son Doong cave expedition tour is full, and some people have to wait for several years. The government only releases about 300–500 permits per year, and once registered, you will have to wait to receive a visitor permit.</p>

            <h3>How to get to Son Doong cave</h3>
            <p>To reach Son Doong Cave, you will walk through a village located inside Phong Nha Ke Bang National Park - Ban Doong. Since it is surrounded by dense forest, the only way to get here is trekking. The village is home to less than 40 people. Before coming to Son Doong, you can linger in this village and interact with the locals, which is also an interesting part of the journey.</p>
            <img src={img9} alt=""></img>
            <p>After that, you will continue your journey to Son Doong Cave, and the road to the cave will start to get harder to walk. You will have to trek through the forest and cross the river for about 2 days to reach the mouth of the cave. And inside the cave, you will have to crawl, roll, climb, jump, swim ... Combine all survival skills with supple health to fully explore this world's largest cave. Another exciting experience is that you will be camping inside the cave, eating, taking special photos and capturing happy memories with your team.</p>
            <img src={img10} alt=""></img>
            <p>The discovery tour will also explore Hang En - the 3rd largest cave in the world. Only 10 guests can visit each batch, and each guest is equipped with dedicated information, skills and guidance. Each team will also include two expert cavers, three local guides, two cooks, two rangers, and 20 porters to help carry belongings and other luggage such as tents and blankets. The safety of the expedition as well as the preservation of the cave are all a top priority. Tours are held once a week between 2 and 8 months. Not only Son Doong, but expeditions to Hang En, Va cave or Tu Lan cave will all bring unique discovery experiences when coming to Quang Binh.</p>
