            <h3>How many trekking routes are there in Ba Den Mountain?</h3>
            <p>Few people know that there are up to seven trekking and climbing routes to Ba Den Mountain, including pagoda road, electric pole road, water pipe road, Ma Thien Lanh road, Phung mountain road, white stone road and HCM road. </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>If you are climbing Ba Den Mountain for the first time, you should choose the popular routes below: </p>
            <br></br>
            <h5>1. Climbing Ba Den mountain and pagoda road</h5>
            <img src={img6} alt=""></img>
            <p>The pagoda road is located behind Ba Pagoda, considered the shortest but also the steepest road to Ba Den mountain. On the way, wild low-growing trees are quite dense, and there are many large rocky slopes, making it a bit difficult to climb. Wear long sleeves to avoid being bitten by insects or scratched by trees. The green space along the temple road is very poetic, so it is quite ideal for people who like to take photos. </p>
            <h5>2. Climb Ba Den mountain along the electric pole road</h5>
            <img src={img7} alt=""></img>
            <p>It can be said that electric pole road is one of the most popular roads among backpackers . This road goes through cool mango and banana forests. On the road there are also guiding arrows and numbered electric poles (from 1 to 117) straight to the top of the mountain so #teamKlook won't be afraid of getting lost. The electric pole path starts from the Martyrs' monument and is quite long, with few passersby and no "supply" stores along the way. You can stop to rest, drink water, and admire the scenery at markers 55 and 65. Climbing time ranges from three to five hours depending on your physical strength. </p>
            <br></br>
            <h5>3. Climb Ba Den Mountain by other routes</h5>
            <p>HCM Road and White Stone Road are two brand new names but have the highest difficulty. The conquest time usually takes about two days, requiring a lot of physical strength and careful packing. You should only go with a local guide who is knowledgeable about trekking and climbing in this area. Besides, the water pipes (behind Ba Pagoda), Ma Thien Lanh Street and Phung Mountain Road are also quite "tense", making it easy to get lost. #teamKlook pay attention!</p>

            <h3>When should you climb Ba Den Mountain?</h3>
            <img src={img8} alt=""></img>

            <img src={img9} alt=""></img>
            <h5>1. Be mentally and physically ready</h5>
            <p>About a month before climbing Ba Den Mountain, train your body with endurance exercises such as jogging, jumping, standing on tiptoes... for about an hour a day. In this way, the body will gradually get used to the high intensity of exercise, limiting unnecessary injuries (cramps, twisted legs, muscle pain...) during the journey.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>#teamKlook also needs to clearly understand that climbing Ba Den Mountain is a backpacking activity that helps you break your limits. The road is difficult and you have to do almost everything yourself, from carrying your backpack, cooking to setting up your camping tent; Sometimes we even have to face troublesome insects or thorny grass. Although the road is not filled with roses, it will definitely be an extremely memorable experience. </p>
            <br></br>
            <h5>2. Have a good pair of shoes</h5>
            <p>You should use specialized sports shoes for trekking, with spiked soles that are easy to grip on rocky slopes. Don't forget a pair of thick socks too. </p>
            <br></br>
            <h5>3. Prepare food, water and medicine in advance</h5>
            <p>Bring dry food to prevent hunger during the trip. Instant noodles, sausages, boiled eggs, candies... as long as they are light and filling, they can "grow". As for water, you should bring at least two liters of water; If you stay overnight, you will need about three to four liters of water. If you are confident about your physical strength, you can bring food and tools to organize a BBQ party while camping. This experience is very "chill".</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>In addition to cold medicine, pain relievers, digestive medicine, first aid supplies, etc., mosquito repellent sprays are also useful "travel companions", helping you temporarily avoid the threat of the mosquito army at almost any time. hungry too. </p>
            <br></br>
            <h5>4. Choose appropriate clothing</h5>
            <br></br>
            <p>Prioritize clothes made from thin, light, sweat-absorbent materials. You should bring an extra jacket and an extra set of clothes to change into if you go at night. Bring identification documents, raincoats, flashlights, room rechargeable batteries, tents, sleeping bags, toilet paper... to best suit your schedule.</p>
