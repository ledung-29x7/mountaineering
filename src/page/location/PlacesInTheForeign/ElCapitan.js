            <p>Looming over Yosemite Valley, El Capitan is considered the most difficult challenge for mountain climbers. Nearly 3,000 feet (900 meters) high, this California rooftop attracts climbers from around the world, but few can say they have actually succeeded.</p>
            <p>The Sierra Nevada Mountains in central California are filled with towering granite giants, but no other peak commands the attention or respect that the vaunted El Capitan does.</p>

            <p>A near-vertical rock wall that dominates Yosemite National Park, it has long captivated the climbing community. Professional climber Tommy Caldwell has completed the first free ascents of several different routes up El Capitan and knows it better than most. The El Cap horn is unbelievably loud, according to Cal Calwell. This is more than 3,000 feet of sheer granite; Looking at it, that doesn't seem right - it doesn't look like you can climb it.</p>
            <p>There are rock faces both steeper and larger, but nothing approaches El Cap's heady mix of height, steepness and sheer slipperiness. It is vast and unforgiving.
            Its challenges have haunted climbers for generations. First fully scaled in 1958 by a team led by Warren Harding (not the US president of that name, who died in 1923 and was less athletic), the hiker involved 46 days of climbing , little by little over a 16-month period, because it's simply too difficult to do in one continuous climb. The group had to drill bolts into the granite and pull themselves up. Due to the difficulties Harding's team encountered, not to mention those who have attempted it since, El Cap has become legendary in the climbing community.
            It still takes almost everyone to climb El Cap. That is to say there is none of the thousands of pounds worth of technical equipment needed to ensure a safe ascent. If you're really good - the absolute elite - then you can free climb it, which means the ascent is done only with hands and feet on the rocks, and with ropes used only as a safety net if you slip.
            In June 2017, free solo Alex Honnold climbed it. No equipment, no ropes, nothing. The official name given to his ridiculous feat is Freerider's First Free Solo (the specific route he took up El Cap), but that doesn't even explain it. What is the achievement?</p>

            <p>This is the most impressive wall on Earth. I've thought about [free soloing] climbing El Cap every year since 2009. I think, 'This is the year,' and then every year I think, 'This really isn't the year. This is fucked. ' Maybe it's not for me, it's for future generations or just someone with nothing to live for.
            Honnold's achievements cannot be overemphasized. Free soloing is so dangerous that fewer than 1 in 100 climbers attempt it. I had 30 or 40 friends or people I knew who were climbing,” Caldwell explains. All the people who have soloed for free a large part of their lives are dead.
            Then there's Honnold, who has completed more than 1,000 free solo ascents. Honnold's exploits are a central part of the new BAFTA-winning Free Solo, a film that begins life as the protagonist instead of “The Stone.” “We knew nothing about soloing El Cap,” said Director Jimmy Chin. El Software almost ended the project because we didn't want to be a part of it in case something went wrong. The rule is that no one is allowed to ask Alex when he will do it.
            Imagine an Olympic gold achievement, but if you don't get that gold medal, you're dead, Caldwell said. That's El Cap. That's what we're talking about.
            Solo El Cap was never really considered a realistic, viable option until Honnold came along. He didn't just climb it; he reached the summit less than four hours after starting. In the film, he even breaks down different sections of the climb, each offering its own terror.
            On the Monster Offference (a specific section on El Cap), the only way climbers can stay on the wall unanswered is by their own body weight and strength. There's no hold for your feet so it's the pressure you apply with your hands that keeps you there. It takes 2,100 feet (640 meters) of climbing to get to that point.</p>

            <p>The higher the monster level, the more it feels like part of your body is always being crushed, Honnold said. While someone is hovering over you and rubbing sandpaper over your body, telling you to hold the position you are in until you vomit, knowing if you lose that position you will die.
            Usually in sports, when an achievement is unlocked, there is a rush to beat or at least match it. Given the challenge that El Cap represents it will probably be a while before someone tries to take Honnold's title. It's hard to imagine climbers scaling a cliff face, half a mile into the sky, relying on the strength of their fingertips to reach the top. Honnold may have tamed it, but the jewel in Yosemite's crown remains the toughest climb on the planet for good reason.</p>
