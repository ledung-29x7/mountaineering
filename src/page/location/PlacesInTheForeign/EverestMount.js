            <h1>Complete Guide to Mount Everest (Facts and Facts about Mount Everest)</h1>
            <p>Since humans officially conquered Mount Everest in 1953, the journey to climb the world's highest mountain has had many changes. Today, hundreds of climbers achieve this feat thanks to significant improvements in knowledge and technique, and “highways to the summit” have been created for those willing to take risks and expensive price.</p>
            <h3>Where is the Everest Mount?</h3>
            <p>Mount Everest is located between the border between Nepal and Tibet on the roof of the world in the Himalayas. Called Sagarmatha by Nepalis and Chomolungma by Tibetans, it was named after Sir George Everest, who led the team that surveyed the mountain in 1841.</p>
            <p>Although climbing to the world's highest peak is an arduous and life-threatening journey due to altitude sickness, landslides and other dangers, there are still many climbers determined to conquer it. standing on the roof of the world.</p>

            <span>This place is magical. I have never seen anything like the Nepal Himalaya</span>
            <h3>How high is Mount Everest?</h3>
            <p>Mount Everest is 8848 meters above sea level, a figure measured by an Indian research team in 1955, and used as the official height by both the Nepalese and Chinese governments to this day.</p>
            <h3>Mount Everest continues to rise</h3>
            <p>Earth scientists predict that Mount Everest is 50 to 60 million years old, still "quite young" compared to other mountains. The peak was formed by the collision between the Indian and Eurasian continental plates, causing the rocks to be pushed up to create the highest peak on earth. The upward push is still happening, causing Mount Everest to rise about 6 millimeters per year.</p>
            <h3>How dangerous is it that high?</h3>
            <p>At an altitude of 8,848m, the amount of oxygen surrounding Mount Everest is only 1/3 of that near sea level, which makes it difficult for climbers to breathe because there is not enough oxygen. According to scientists, the human body cannot withstand altitudes above 6,000 meters. The higher you climb, the less oxygen you have and the body will face many risks including pulmonary edema, cerebral edema and blood vessel blockage. In addition, damage from frostbite will increase rapidly because at such a high altitude the heart has to work harder to send blood throughout the body to bring oxygen to the organs. Internal organs are given higher priority, fingers and toes are last, so when exposed to cold, frostbite occurs, causing people to have to amputate their fingers and toes.</p>
            <h3>What does Mount Everest look like?</h3>
            <img src={img2} alt=""></img>
            <span>Look at Mount Everest, and all I see is a pyramid</span>
            <p>The top of Mount Everest looks like a three-sided pyramid and is about the size of a dining room, covered in snow all year round. At the top, there is enough room for about 6 people to stand to admire the scenery and take photos. On a crowded day, climbers must sequentially give up their seats to each other to stand at the top of the world.</p>
            <h3>Which season is suitable to climb Mount Everest?</h3>
            <p>There are only two periods when the weather on Everest is suitable for summit climbing. The best weather conditions for climbing Mount Everest fall between mid-late May before the rainy season (monsoon) arrives. When the rainy season comes, the snow is too soft and landslides will easily occur. After the rainy season weather conditions may permit another short climb around October. Winter snowstorms will begin from autumn until March making climbing impossible.</p>
            <h5>That reason is due to the climate of Mount Everest.</h5>
            <p>Everest's climate is deadly. The warmest day is about -19 degrees Celsius (July) on the summit, but in January the temperature on the summit falls to -36 degrees Celsius. Storms can come at any time and temperatures can drop quickly without warning. predict. Mount Everest is so high that it reaches the lowest limit of cyclones, and produces winds of 160km per hour. Snow falls in the summer months (mid-May to mid-September) so the possibility of frostbite will be very high.</p>
            <h3>How long does it take to climb Mount Everest?</h3>
            <p>40 days is the minimum number to climb Everest to give the body enough time to get used to the altitude.
            To prepare for the day of conquering the mountain in May, preparations for a successful climbing trip begin a month before. Most climbing groups from all over the world gather in Kathmandu at the end of March to begin the acclimatization process. Start trekking to basecamp (base camp), from here climbing guide groups are ready to support the climbing journey, bring food and equipment, and prepare the way to the top.
            Around April, climbers practice many nights at higher camps to get used to the altitude while groups of Nepalese guides reach the summit. In the second week of May, the team prepared a route with fixed ropes from the basecamp to the summit, and many fully equipped camps along the way.
            After the final rest, some groups will break camp and descend the mountain to recover – and the final climb will be an arduous 4-5 days. If all goes well, most climbers will conquer Mount Everest and be on their way home by early June.</p>
            <h3>How dangerous is climbing Everest?</h3>
            <p>According to the Himalayan Database reports at the end of 2018, 295 people died while climbing Everest, while there were 9,159 successful climbs by 5,294 people. The death rate is about 1.2%, which means that for every 100 climbers, 1 will stay on the road forever.
            The main causes of death were landslides (41.6%), falls (12.5%), falls, altitude sickness (16.6%), and exposure to extreme temperatures.
            “Climbing Mount Everest has become safer thanks to better climbing equipment, more accurate weather forecasts and more commercial climbers,” said Alan Arnette. “From 1923 to 1999: 170 deaths in 1,169 climbs, a rate of 14.5%. But the death rate gradually decreased from 2000 to 2018 with 7,990 climbs and 123 deaths, down to 1.5%.”</p>
            <h3>How many routes are there to the top?</h3>

            <span>The road to the highest mountain in the world! Everest Moutain</span>
            <p>Although there are 17 routes to the top, most people only climb one of the two routes. In Nepal it is the Southeast Ridge created by Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hilary in 1953. From Tibet, it is the North Ridge as George Mallory disappeared in 1924 long before a Chinese delegation The country conquered the peak in 1960.
            Climbers rated the difficulty of the two routes as comparable, but the challenges were different. Climbing from the southeast, they faced a race over the treacherous Khumbu Icefall ice wall but as the day approached the summit was shorter and easier to descend in an emergency. Climbing from the North, you can travel by car all the way to the base camp, but climbers have to climb very long to reach the top.</p>
            <h3>How crowded is Everest?</h3>
            <p>The popularity of Mount Everest began to rise in the 1990s when international tour guide groups began opening commercial climbing tours to the summit. Despite the dangers lurking, Mount Everest still attracts hundreds of climbers from all over the world. In 2018 alone, Nepal's tourism ministry issued permits to 347 foreigners and according to recorded data, 261 people conquered with the help of 302 guides and porters. As for the north side, about 239 people have reached the top.</p>
            <h3>How much does it cost to climb Everest?</h3>
            <p>To get a position in a climbing group, it costs from $40,000 to $100,000 USD depending on climbing services and equipment. Nepal's tourism ministry collects about $5.2 million USD each year for climbing permits alone, so Everest is a big business.
            The mountaineering industry must rely on the shoulders of Nepal's professional mountain guides. Every spring they prepare climbing paths, fix ladders and climbing ropes, equip tents with oxygen tanks, food, cooking utensils and patiently guide foreign visitors to the top.
            In the past, Sherpa people - a Tibetan tribe living near the top of this mountain - were hired by expedition teams to carry supplies up the mountain. Nowadays, many other people are also recruited into the team, they are called " climbing workers". In 3-4 months of climbing, most will earn between $2,500 - $5000. In recent years, the Khumbu Climbing Center organization has organized training so that Nepali guides can have international climbing certificates.</p>
            <h3>Sherpa people are unsung heroes</h3>
            <p>Mount Everest is too high and the climate too harsh for anyone to live in, but the valley at its base is inhabited by people of Tibetan descent, known as Sherpa, in villages as high as 4,870 meters. Traditionally they farmed on arable land, and they led a semi-nomadic lifestyle in search of grazing land. In summer, livestock are released at an altitude of 4,880 meters while in winter they take shelter at stations near the river.
            Living close to the highest mountain peak on earth, Sherpas consider the Himalayas sacred – they build Buddhist monasteries, hang lungta flags on hilltops and establish refuges for wildlife such as muskrats and pheasants. .
            Gods and demons are said to live on the mountaintops, and the Yeti (giant snowman) is said to roam the lower slopes. Therefore, sherpas traditionally do not climb mountains.
            However, today they are silent heroes helping climbers carry tents, food and drinks to high camps. Supporting climbing groups helps bring in income to support the family.</p>
            <h3>The Sherpas perform a Puja to ask the gods for permission to climb the peak</h3>
            <p>Because the mountain peak is considered sacred, there must be prayer ceremonies (Puja) to ask for permission to climb, which are held at the base camp before starting to climb. The prayer ceremony is led by Buddhist lamas and during the ceremony they pray for good luck and protection for the climbers to climb safely. They also pray for climbing equipment.
            For Sherpas, such steps are very important before starting to climb, most of them would not climb without participating in this ceremony. Is it superstition? But this tradition has been around for hundreds of years, so even foreigners participate.</p>
            <h3>Conquer Everest and milestones</h3>
            <p>The first person to explore climbing Everest was George Mallory in 1924, he disappeared near the summit leaving a mystery as to whether he had actually conquered the summit. The truth may lie in the fact that his camera also disappeared which could change the history of mountaineering.
            The first people to successfully conquer Mount Everest were Edmund Hillary (New Zealand) and Tenzing Norgay (Nepal) on May 29, 1953, they conquered Mount Everest on the southern route. The British expedition was led by Colonel John Hunt.
            The record for climbing the highest mountain in the world belongs to Kami Rita Sherpa (May 2019), who has conquered Everest 23 times.
            The youngest person to climb Everest is Jordan Romero (US citizen), 13 years old on May 23, 2010 from the north.
            The oldest person to climb Everest is Miura Yiuchiro (80 years old, Japanese) on May 23, 2013</p>
            <h3>Is there anything left to explore in Everest?</h3>
            <p>The newly discovered climbing route was conquered by a Russian team in 2004. While the three main faces of Mount Everest have been conquered, there remain challenges for future climbers. Includes Fantasy Ridge also known as the horseshoe climb, a link between Everest and its neighbors Lhotse and Nuptse.
            “Everest is in some ways a blank canvas,” says National Geographic photographer Cory Richard. “It's still as high and cold as ever. How one chooses how to climb reflects creativity in skill. There is always a new way to approach a problem, and Everest is no exception."</p>
