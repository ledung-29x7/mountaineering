            <h1>Fuji Mountain</h1>
            <h3>1. Geographical location</h3>
            <p>Mount Fuji is an active stratovolcano located on the Japanese island of Honshū, with a summit elevation of 3,776.24 m (12,389 ft 3 in). It is the tallest mountain in Japan, the second-highest volcano located on an island in Asia (after Mount Kerinci on the island of Sumatra), and seventh-highest peak of an island on Earth. Mount Fuji last erupted from 1707 to 1708. The mountain is located about 100 km (62 mi) southwest of Tokyo and is visible from the Japanese capital on clear days. Mount Fuji's exceptionally symmetrical cone, which is covered in snow for about five months of the year, is commonly used as a cultural icon of Japan and is frequently depicted in art and photography, as well as visited by sightseers, hikers and mountain climbers.</p>

            <h3>2. How to climb Mount Fuji</h3>
            <p>Many visitors choose to climb Mt Fuji over 2 days so they can enjoy it at a more relaxing pace and take more breaks. Climbing at a calm, steady pace is recommended and helps climbers to avoid problems such as exhaustion and altitude sickness.</p>
            <p><strong>Difficulty</strong>The ascent to the top of Mt Fuji is relatively easy as long as you’re in good shape. There are a few challenging parts which are steep and rocky but they are not frequent. The main challenge is the altitude which can cause climbers problems, especially those with little climbing experience.</p>
            <p><strong>Timing</strong>The sunrise from Mt Fuji is spectacular and most people try to time their climb to witness it. Visibility is normally better in the early morning too. The recommended way of doing this is to climb Mt Fuji over 2 days. Getting close to the top on the first day makes it easy to get to the top on the second.</p>
            <p><strong>Mountain huts</strong>The Yoshida Trail has more mountain huts than the other trails. There are around 15 between the 7th and 8th stations. Overnight stays cost around 5000 yen per person without food. During peak season you should make reservations as they can be fully booked. Some mountain huts allow people to stay for short periods and charge by the hour.</p>

            <h3>3. Useful tips for climbing Mt Fuji</h3>
            <p>Good preparation is key to avoiding problems when climbing Mt Fuji. Having the right clothing, equipment, and supplies is recommended and visitors should respect the high altitudes. Here is some useful tips to keep in mind.</p>
            <li><strong>To avoid altitude sickness: </strong> trek at a slow pace, take regular breaks, and stay hydrated. If you start to feel ill or get a headache the best thing to do is descend the mountain.</li>
            <li><strong>Wear walking boots: </strong> take some good-quality walking boots and wear them in during the weeks leading up to your climb. Don’t make the mistake of buying new boots just before as they will cause blisters!</li>
            <li><strong>Be ready for cold, wind, and rain: </strong> the temperature at the summit can be below zero and strong winds can make it even colder. Make sure you take clothes which protect you from the weather conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Take a flashlight or headlamp: </strong>  this is essential if you hike at night or very early in the morning. Headlamps are a good option as they leave both your hands free.</li>
            <li><strong>Bring plenty of food and water: </strong>mountain huts offer food and drink though there are very few of them on some trails and the higher you go up, the higher the prices (so take some money just in case!). There are no bins along the trails so it’s good manners to keep all your rubbish on you until the end of your Fuji excursion.</li>

            <h3>4. The Hidden Dangers of Mt. Fuji</h3>
            <p>Climbing Mt. Fuji is not a walk in the park. The terrain can be steep and rocky, and sudden wind gusts can make the climb even more challenging. It's not just about physical fitness, but also about preparing for the unexpected. Altitude sickness is a common issue, as the air gets notably thinner as you gain altitude. This can lead to symptoms like headache, dizziness, and nausea.</p>
